          <p class="card first-card">
            It's especially hard to concentrate when there are many tasks, and all of them are important. Where is the legendary multitasking when you need it most (and when all the hiring managers of the world need it)? The thing is, it simply doesn't exist. Researchers <a class="link link-style" href="https://dana.org/article/multicosts-of-multitasking/" target="_blank">figured it out</a>, that the brain has a hard time concentrating even on two tasks at the same time. And when several important tasks enter our field of attention, the body panics and releases cortisol and adrenaline — the "stress hormones." As a result, we work inattentively: we make mistakes and get tired quickly.

          <h3 class="accent-text title-decor title-margin header-dophamine">Dopamine</h3>
          <p class="card second-card">
            We understand the stress hormones, but what comes next is even more interesting. Our inability to concentrate is also influenced by the complete opposite of stress — dopamine. This substance is involved in the brain's reward system. What does it have to do with this? We often distract ourselves from important tasks with something more "pleasurable" for our brains. For example, checking likes on social media. During this time, dopamine is released, and we feel pleasure. It creates a vicious cycle: the more you get distracted, the more pleasure you receive.

        <h2 class="main-points">What reduces concentration?</h2>
        <h3 class="accent-text multitask title-decor title-margin">Concentration</h3>
        <p class="card-multitask card">
          How can concentration decrease due to… concentration? Any stressful situation (and the rapidly changing world in general) makes our brains constantly "scan" the environment for danger. For example, reading the news instead of working. But being focused all the time is impossible. Concentration is like a muscle, and it can become strained if we don’t give it a break.

        <h3 class="accent-text eat title-decor title-margin">Food</h3>
        <p class="card-eat card">
          "Fast carbohydrates" — sugar, white bread, sweets — deliver energy to the brain instantly and help it function better. However, this energy dissipates just as quickly as it arrives. As a result, we end up on the "carb swings": as soon as the effects of the "fast carbohydrates" wear off, we feel tired and drowsy. And we crave even more fast carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <h3 class="accent-text devices title-decor title-margin">Gadgets</h3>
        <p class="card-devices card">
          Yes, yes, this is the situation where there’s code on the laptop screen, a podcast in the headphones, and a video of funny ducklings playing in the background on the computer. As a result, the brain tries to switch from one task to another — and simply can't. To return to a state of full concentration, a person typically needs about 20 minutes. So, the more time we spend on gadgets, the more time we then need to get back to work.

        <h2 class="main-points">How to concentrate better than a goldfish (that is, longer than three seconds).</h2>
        <div class="text-article-content">
          <h3 class="accent-text title-decor content-subtitle">5 simple (but actually not so simple) tips</h3>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Imagine the sky and clouds</h4>
          <p class="card">
            Or leaves in a stream. This is about a simple meditation that helps to calm down. Often, it's the anxious thoughts about complex tasks that prevent us from completing those tasks. In such moments, you can close your eyes and imagine that the clear sky represents you, while the clouds represent your anxious thoughts. No matter how many there are, the clear sky will always be somewhere behind the clouds and will never disappear. This exercise can help you return to the present moment rather than worry about potential problems in the future.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Turn on the music</h4>
          <p class="card">
            But not just any music, and not your favorite. Your favorite music may be associated with strong positive emotions, which can also be very distracting. Soft, calming, moderately rhythmic music will do. You could even try playing a playlist with "white noise" or neuro music.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Take a walk</h4>
          <p class="card">
            Or even go for a run. It's best to find a park or a forest: one experiment <a class="link link-style" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494415000328" target="_blank">showed</a>, that nature contemplation increases concentration, while viewing urban landscapes decreases it. You can combine walking with physical exercises or running — this way, more oxygen will reach the brain, and it will function better. However, a simple twenty-minute walk is also a great option.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Eat well</h4>
          <p class="card">
            We’re not your grandma, but it’s really important. Choose foods that prevent sharp spikes in blood sugar. For example, those high in fiber: vegetables, berries, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans), brown rice, whole grain bread.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle-text title-decor title-margin">Read more</h4>
          <p class="card">
            Real paper books. This really helps with concentration: to read a post on social media, just a few minutes or even seconds are enough. However, an interesting book can pull you in for several hours and greatly trains your focused attention.
